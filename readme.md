##About
Los Angeles is one of the most interesting and diverse cities in the world, with thousands of sights and locations to explore. However, exploring LA may be difficult for students who don't drive. BusLA makes exploring LA easy by showing a variety of locations that are bus-able from UCLA campus.

##Instructions

To use, simply navigate around the map and click on map markers to show more information about that location. Bus routes are highlighted on the map, click on a bus route to filter locations to those only avaliable from that particular bus route. To switch to a list view instead of a map view, click on "Switch to List" in the top right. Category/price filtering is also avaliable in the top right hand corner.
